# 🗳️ Voting System (C++ Project)

This is a simple Voting System implemented in **C++** using **Data Structures and Algorithms**.

## ⚙️ Features
- Stores candidates and votes efficiently using `map`
- Prevents duplicate votes using `set`
- Finds winner using `max_element` algorithm
- Saves results in `votes.csv` for persistence
- Easy to compile and run

## 🧠 DSA Concepts Used
| Concept | Where Used |
|----------|-------------|
| `map` | Storing votes |
| `set` | Storing voter IDs |
| `vector` | Candidate list |
| `sort` | Ranking candidates |
| `max_element` | Finding winner |

## 🚀 Run Instructions

### 1️⃣ Build the program
```bash
# 🗳️ Voting System

Simple desktop voting application written in C++ with a Qt GUI. It demonstrates basic data structures and algorithms for managing candidates, preventing duplicate votes, and producing results.

**This repository contains:** a small Qt-based GUI (`gui.cpp`) and the program entry (`main.cpp`). A macOS app bundle is generated by the included `Makefile` when built with Qt.

**Status:** Build system generated by `qmake` / Qt (see `Makefile`).

**Prerequisites**
- macOS with Xcode command line tools (clang/clang++)
- Qt 6 (installed via Homebrew or Qt installer). On macOS with Homebrew the Qt tools are typically under `/opt/homebrew/opt/qt`.
- `make` and `qmake` available in PATH (or use full paths from your environment).

**Quick build & run**
1. Build the project:

```bash
make
```

2. Run the built app bundle (macOS):

```bash
open voting-system.app
```

Or run the executable directly:

```bash
./voting-system.app/Contents/MacOS/voting-system
```

If you prefer building manually (without the `Makefile`), compile the sources with your C++ compiler and link against Qt frameworks.

**What the program does**
- Stores candidates and votes (uses C++ containers such as `std::map`, `std::set`, and `std::vector`).
- Prevents duplicate voting by tracking voter IDs.
- Computes and displays the winner using standard algorithms (`std::max_element`).
- Exports or saves results to a CSV file (if implemented in the UI flow).

**Repository layout**
- `gui.cpp` — Qt GUI implementation.
- `main.cpp` — application entry point.
- `Makefile` — qmake-generated build rules for building an app bundle.
- `voting-system.pro` — Qt project file used to generate the Makefile.
- `voting-system.app/` — generated macOS app bundle after building.

**Notes & troubleshooting**
- If `qmake` is not on your PATH, install Qt via Homebrew (`brew install qt`) and add `/opt/homebrew/opt/qt/bin` to your PATH, or run `qmake` with its full path.
- For Qt GUI builds make sure the Qt libraries are discoverable at runtime; `open voting-system.app` will launch the bundled app on macOS if the bundle is created successfully.

**License**
- No license is specified. Add a `LICENSE` file if you want to publish under an open-source license.
